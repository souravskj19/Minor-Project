# Stock Prediction using Python

## Introduction
The **Stock Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application that predicts stock prices based on historical data and various predictive models. It utilizes Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and deep learning to generate insights into future stock trends.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Fetch real-time and historical stock data using APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Visualization:** Interactive charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Predictive Models:** Implement machine learning models like Linear Regression, ARIMA, LSTM, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measure accuracy with RMSE, MSE, and R-squared scores.
- **Live Prediction:** Predict future stock prices based on real-time data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels
- **Data Sources:** Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Quandl
- **Modeling Techniques:** Regression, Time Series Analysis, Deep Learning (LSTM, GRU)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Install Python (>=3.7)
- Install required dependencies

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stock-prediction.git
   cd stock-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up API keys for data sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.).
4. Run the stock prediction script:
   ```sh
   python stock_prediction.py
   ```

## Usage
- Modify `config.py` to set stock symbols and API keys.
- Run the script to fetch historical data and train models.
- View predictions and analysis through generated plots.
